# GPS "U-Blox-7"
Quick implementation to integrate a GPS "U-Blox 7" in NODE-RED (LINUX).

Development on the "GC10NEXT" Geiger Counter on "Node-RED" ("https://nodered.org/docs/getting-started/")
Most of the Node-RED implementation code fundamentals came from reading ("https://content.u-blox.com/sites/default/files/products/documents/u-blox7-V14_ReceiverDescriptionProtocolSpec_%28GPS.G7-SW-12001%29_Public.pdf")
I would like to add more features, specially for the "U-Blox 7", TBD.
I am only interested in making this work in LINUX, if someone decides to have it run in Windows, do create a different branch.
Feel free to add as needed
